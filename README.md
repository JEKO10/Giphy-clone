## Project task

One of the first projects I created using React. This is my first time working with a third-party API. I used the Giphy API to make a Giphy clone.

## Project overview

The home page displays trending gifs with a search bar. You can search for plenty of gifs from Giphy. I used fetch and promises to get API data. I also created Loader and Pagination for gifs.

## Built with

- React
- CSS
